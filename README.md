# Remote / Hybrid / On-site Machine Learning Model
In this notebook, I'm working on building a machine learning model to determine whether a job posting is remote, hybrid, or on-site. 

I'm working on this because most job sites, ATS systems, etc, each have their own different schema for how they classify if a job falls into any of those categories. 

So instead of relying on figuring out all the different schemas, I'm building a ML model to determine what category the job posting should be in. 

I'm using this dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings

Feel free to play around with what I've got so far. And if you do, let me know how it goes building your own model!
